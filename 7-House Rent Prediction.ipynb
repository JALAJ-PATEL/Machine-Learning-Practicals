    "### Encoding Categorical Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are no missing values, we can proceed to encode the categorical attributes (i.e., those with `object` data types) so that they can be used in machine learning models. The categorical attributes in our dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Area Type**: Categorical with values like `\"Super Area\"`, `\"Carpet Area\"`, etc.\n",
    "2. **Area Locality**: Categorical, each representing a specific locality.\n",
    "3. **City**: Categorical with names of cities.\n",
    "4. **Furnishing Status**: Categorical with values like `\"Furnished\"`, `\"Unfurnished\"`, etc.\n",
    "5. **Point of Contact**: Categorical, usually indicating who to contact. This column might not be important for prediction and can be dropped if irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encode the categorical features, we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Label Encoding** for attributes with a small number of categories (like `Area Type` and `Furnishing Status`). This will convert categorical values into numerical labels, which is suitable when there are limited and distinct categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding** for attributes with a larger number of unique categories (like `Area Locality` and `City`). This will create binary (0 or 1) columns for each category, which is useful to avoid imposing any ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. Use `Label Encoding` for:\n",
    "   - `Area Type`\n",
    "   - `Furnishing Status`\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Use `One-Hot Encoding` for:\n",
    "   - `Area Locality`\n",
    "   - `City`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The column `Point of Contact` will be dropped, assuming it does not provide useful information for predicting the rent.\n"

    "## **Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bagging\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) involves training multiple versions of a model on different subsets of the training data (by sampling with replacement) and averaging their predictions. This reduces variance and prevents overfitting. We will use **Random Forest** for Bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Boosting\n",
    "Boosting is an iterative method that adjusts the weights of observations based on the previous model's errors. It trains a sequence of models, with each new model focusing on correcting the errors made by the previous one. We will use **AdaBoost** and **XGBoost** for Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RandomForestRegressor**: A bagging technique that combines multiple decision trees to reduce variance.\n",
    "- **AdaBoostRegressor**: A boosting technique that combines weak learners (e.g., decision trees) by giving more weight to hard-to-predict instances.\n",
    "- **XGBRegressor**: A boosting algorithm that builds strong predictive models by sequentially correcting errors from weak models, with additional regularization to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries**:\n",
    "    - We import the necessary libraries for implementing the models and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Models**:\n",
    "    - **RandomForestRegressor**: A bagging model to reduce variance.\n",
    "    - **AdaBoostRegressor**: A boosting model to iteratively improve predictions.\n",
    "    - **XGBRegressor**: A scalable and efficient gradient boosting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Models**:\n",
    "    - We define a function `evaluate_model` to train and test each model, compute predictions, and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like **MSE**, **RMSE**, and **R² Score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training and Testing**:\n",
    "    - For each model, we train the model on the training set (`X_train`, `y_train`) and make predictions on the test set (`X_test`).\n",
    "    - We then evaluate the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R² Score**.\n"

    "### Conclusion of the House Rent Prediction Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project was to predict house rent prices using three different regression models: **Random Forest**, **AdaBoost**, and **XGBoost**. Below is a detailed evaluation of each model based on their performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Forest Regressor**:\n",
    "   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 1,04,81,97,798.21\n",
    "   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 32,375.88\n",
    "   - **R-squared (R² Score)**: 0.70\n",
    "   - The Random Forest model provided a decent performance, capturing a good amount of variance in the data with an R² score of 0.70. However, it still leaves room for improvement, as the RMSE suggests that there’s a substantial average prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **AdaBoost Regressor**:\n",
    "   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 1,63,23,08,156.71\n",
    "   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 40,401.83\n",
    "   - **R-squared (R² Score)**: 0.54\n",
    "   - The AdaBoost model had a lower performance compared to Random Forest, with a higher MSE and RMSE. An R² score of 0.54 indicates that it was able to explain about half of the variance in the target variable. This suggests that while the model has some predictive power, it may not be the best choice for this dataset without further tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **XGBoost Regressor**:\n",
    "   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 97,82,27,620.26\n",
    "   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 31.276.63\n",
    "   - **R-squared (R² Score)**: 0.72\n",
    "   - XGBoost was the top performer among the three models, with the lowest MSE and RMSE, and the highest R² score of 0.72. This indicates that XGBoost was able to capture most of the variance in the data, leading to better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "- **XGBoost** is the best model for predicting house rent in this dataset, providing the highest accuracy and the smallest average error.\n",
    "- **Random Forest** is a strong alternative with decent performance, but it may require additional tuning or feature engineering to match the precision of XGBoost.\n",
    "- **AdaBoost** did not perform as well as the other models, likely due to its sensitivity to noise and the need for carefully tuned hyperparameters.\n",
